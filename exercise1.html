        <p>
            Dear Aileen,<br><br>
            Thank you for your recent aplication to join as at the University of Awesom´s science faculty to study as
            part
            of your PhD next year.
            I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Starting dates
        </h3>
        <p>
            We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,
            however it would suit us better if you could start the begining of a semester; the start dates for each one
            are
            as follows:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
            You can find more information about on our website<br>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Subjects of study
        </h3>
        <p>
            At the awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facilty -- as long as the subjects
            fall
            somewhere in the realm of science and tecnology. You seem like and inteligent, dedicated researcher, and
            just
            the
            kind of person we´d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
            by
            are
            as follows, in order of priority:<br>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
                (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
            </li>
            <li>
                Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers al temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86ºF), when the
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>> 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you´d expect the
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we´d need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

            Exotic dance moves
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes, you are rigth! As part of my post-doctorate work, <i>I did study exotic tribal dances.</i> To answer
            your
            question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br>
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt class="subtittle">Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>
                A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole
                village would dance around
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt class="subtittle">
                Artic robot dance
            </dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
                believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements,
                being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
            </dd>
        </dl>
