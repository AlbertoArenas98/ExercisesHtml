    <h1><strong>Re: Eileen Dover University Aplication</strong></h1>
    <p>Dear Aileen,<br>
        Thank you for your recent aplication to join as at the University of Awesom´s science faculty to study as part
        of your PhD next year.
        I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,
        however it would suit us better if you could start the begining of a semester; the start dates for each one are
        as follows:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
        You can find more information about
        <link rel="stylesheet" href=""> on our website<br>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    At the awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facilty -- as long as the subjects fall
    somewhere in the realm of science and tecnology. You seem like and inteligent, dedicated researcher, and just the
    kind of person we´d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are
    as follows, in order of priority:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
            (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers al temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86ºF), when the
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>> 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you´d expect the
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we´d need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are rigth! As part of my post-doctorate work, <i>I did study exotic tribal dances.</i> To answer your
        question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br>
        Polynesian chicken dance <br>
        <p; style="padding-left: 20px;">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole
            village would dance around
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
    </p>
    Artic robot dance<br>
    <p; style="padding-left: 20px;">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
        believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements,
        being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
